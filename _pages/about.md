I am a final-year Master's student at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), specializing in [Mathematics Vision Learning (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). 

I hold a Master's degree from École Polytechnique and I am pursuing my final year master at ENS Paris Saclay within the M2 MVA. I interned in 2024 as a research intern in the [Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning group](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/organisations/immunoinformatics-and-machine-learning) at DTU, where I worked on innovative machine learning algorithms to predict T-Cell Receptor specificity. Additionally, I interned at [AQEMIA](https://www.aqemia.com/), enhancing therapeutic target identification processes.
