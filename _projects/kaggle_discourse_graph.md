## Betbot on tennis matches data

As tennis is my passion for a long time now, I have created a betbot that is able to fetch data from websites and compute complex Deep Learning algorithms to predict the winner of future matches.
Betbot for tennis match predictions based on `FlashResultat` statistics and `ATPtour` statistics.

### Description

This betbot is a tool designed to predict outcomes of tennis matches by analyzing data from FlashResultat and ATP statistics. The model leverages historical match data to provide insights and forecasts for future matches.

### Features

- Fetches real-time match data from `FlashResultat`.
- Analyzes ATP player statistics.
- Provides predictions based on historical and current data.
- User-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.
