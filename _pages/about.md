I am Mathias Grau, a final-year Master's student at École Polytechnique, specializing in Mathematics Vision Learning (MVA) at Université Paris-Saclay. 

With a strong academic foundation in applied mathematics, I hold a Master's degree from École Polytechnique and I am pursuing my final year master at ENS Paris Saclay within the M2 MVA. I have gained valuable experience as a research intern in the Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning group at DTU, where I developed innovative machine learning algorithms to predict T-Cell Receptor specificity. Additionally, I interned at AQEMIA, enhancing therapeutic target identification processes through data analysis. Proficient in multiple programming languages and fluent in several languages, I am passionate about blending mathematics and technology to make impactful contributions in my field.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing tennis and football, and I have a deep appreciation for music, having played the piano for nine years.
